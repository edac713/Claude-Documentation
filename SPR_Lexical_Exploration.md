## Formal Definitions

### 1. Sparse Priming Representations (SPRs)

> *A methodological approach in artificial intelligence and natural language processing that employs minimal but strategically selected data inputs to stimulate and direct the knowledge retrieval processes of large language models (LLMs).*

### 2. Knowledge Priming Technique

> *A process by which large language models are influenced or guided using specifically tailored input sequences to optimize their ability to recall and utilize embedded latent knowledge.*

### Latent Knowledge Activation

> The act of triggering the recall of implicit information within large-scale AI models through the use of concise and targeted prompts or cues.

## Common Terms

### Latent Knowledge

> Information stored within a model that is not immediately apparent or active but can be accessed with specific triggers.

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

> Advanced AI systems capable of understanding, generating, and interacting with human language at a large scale.

### Priming

> The process of influencing a model's response or behavior by providing specific information or context beforehand.

### Input Sequences

> Ordered sets of data or commands given to a model to process.

### Efficiency in AI

> The measure of how effectively an AI system can achieve its objectives with minimal resource expenditure.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

> The field of AI focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

### Cues

> Signals or pieces of information that guide the recall or response processes.

### Knowledge Retrieval

> The process of accessing and bringing into active use information stored within an AI system.

### Embedded Knowledge

> Information that is integrated and stored within an AI system's architecture.

### Activation

> The process of making latent or inactive information active and accessible.
