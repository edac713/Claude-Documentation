**Sparse Priming Representations (SPRs)** - `n.`  A methodological approach in *artificial intelligence*
and **_natural language processing_** that employs minimal but strategically selected data inputs to
"stimulate and direct" the knowledge retrieval processes of ***large language models (LLMs)***.

**Knowledge Priming Technique**  `n.`  A process by which *large language models* are influenced or
guided using specifically tailored **_input sequences_** to optimize their ability to `recall` and
utilize embedded **latent knowledge**.

**Latent Knowledge Activation**  `n.`  The act of triggering the *recall* of implicit information
within **_large-scale AI models_** through the use of concise and targeted `prompts` or **cues**.

**Latent Knowledge**  `n.`  Information stored within a *model* that is not immediately apparent or
active but can be accessed with specific **_triggers_**.

**Large Language Models (LLMs)**  `n.`  Advanced *AI systems* capable of understanding, generating,
and interacting with **_human language_** at a `large scale`.

**Priming**  `n.`  The process of *influencing* a model's response or behavior by providing specific
information or **_context_** beforehand.

**Input Sequences**  `n.`  Ordered sets of *data* or commands given to a **_model_** to `process`.

**Efficiency in AI**  `n.`  The measure of how effectively an *AI system* can achieve its objectives
with minimal **_resource expenditure_**.

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  `n.`  The field of *AI* focused on enabling machines to
understand, interpret, and generate **_human language_**.

**Cues**  `n.`  Signals or pieces of *information* that guide the `recall` or **_response processes_**.

**Knowledge Retrieval**  `n.`  The process of *accessing* and bringing into active use information
stored within an **_AI system_**.

**Embedded Knowledge**  `n.`  Information that is *integrated* and stored within an AI system's
**_architecture_**.

**Activation**  `n.`  The process of making *latent* or inactive information **_active_** and `accessible`.
