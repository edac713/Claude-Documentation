### Sparse Priming Representations (SPRs)

`n.` A methodological approach in _artificial intelligence_
and **_natural language processing_** that employs minimal but strategically selected data inputs to
"stimulate and direct" the knowledge retrieval processes of **_large language models (LLMs)_**.

### Knowledge Priming Technique

`n.` A process by which _large language models_ are influenced or
guided using specifically tailored **_input sequences_** to optimize their ability to `recall` and
utilize embedded **latent knowledge**.

### Latent Knowledge Activation

`n.` The act of triggering the _recall_ of implicit information
within **_large-scale AI models_** through the use of concise and targeted `prompts` or **cues**.

### Latent Knowledge

`n.` Information stored within a _model_ that is not immediately apparent or
active but can be accessed with specific **_triggers_**.

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

`n.` Advanced _AI systems_ capable of understanding, generating,
and interacting with **_human language_** at a `large scale`.

### Priming

`n.` The process of _influencing_ a model's response or behavior by providing specific
information or **_context_** beforehand.

### Input Sequences

`n.` Ordered sets of _data_ or commands given to a **_model_** to `process`.

### Efficiency in AI

`n.` The measure of how effectively an _AI system_ can achieve its objectives
with minimal **_resource expenditure_**.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

`n.` The field of _AI_ focused on enabling machines to
understand, interpret, and generate **_human language_**.

### Cues

`n.` Signals or pieces of _information_ that guide the `recall` or **_response processes_**.

### Knowledge Retrieval

`n.` The process of _accessing_ and bringing into active use information
stored within an **_AI system_**.

### Embedded Knowledge

`n.` Information that is _integrated_ and stored within an AI system's
**_architecture_**.

### Activation

`n.` The process of making _latent_ or inactive information **_active_** and `accessible`.
