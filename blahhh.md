### Sparse Priming Representations (SPRs)
`n.`  A methodological approach in *artificial intelligence*
and ***natural language processing*** that employs minimal but strategically selected data inputs to
"stimulate and direct" the knowledge retrieval processes of ***large language models (LLMs)***.
---
### Knowledge Priming Technique
`n.`  A process by which *large language models* are influenced or
guided using specifically tailored ***input sequences*** to optimize their ability to `recall` and
utilize embedded **latent knowledge**.
---
### Latent Knowledge Activation
`n.`  The act of triggering the *recall* of implicit information
within ***large-scale AI models*** through the use of concise and targeted `prompts` or **cues**.

### Latent Knowledge
`n.`  Information stored within a *model* that is not immediately apparent or
active but can be accessed with specific ***triggers***.

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
`n.`  Advanced *AI systems* capable of understanding, generating,
and interacting with ***human language*** at a `large scale`.

### Priming
`n.`  The process of *influencing* a model's response or behavior by providing specific
information or ***context*** beforehand.

### Input Sequences
`n.`  Ordered sets of *data* or commands given to a ***model*** to `process`.

### Efficiency in AI
`n.`  The measure of how effectively an *AI system* can achieve its objectives
with minimal ***resource expenditure***.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
`n.`  The field of *AI* focused on enabling machines to
understand, interpret, and generate ***human language***.

### Cues
`n.`  Signals or pieces of *information* that guide the `recall` or ***response processes***.

### Knowledge Retrieval
`n.`  The process of *accessing* and bringing into active use information
stored within an ***AI system***.

### Embedded Knowledge
`n.`  Information that is *integrated* and stored within an AI system's
***architecture***.

### Activation
`n.`  The process of making *latent* or inactive information ***active*** and `accessible`.
